# StudentLive Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension aims to connect teachers to students during presentations so students can follow through the slides and ask questions which will be tied to the slides with timestamps.

Once you have the extension installed, you can select being either a "Teacher" or a "Student." By entering and submitting a class code, you can then either create or join a class. For students, clicking the "Go Live" button will send you to your teachers slide!

This project also relies on a [backend](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/student_live_backend).

## Next Steps
While the question and upvoting features are built into the extension UI and the backend, they have yet to be tied together. By finishing this part of the project, we would complete our full initial vision where teachers would also be able to track questions per slide and by timestamp.

## Loading as an Unpacked Extension
In order to use this estension in chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`, turn on developer mode, click on "Load unpacked", and then select this directory. The extension will then be added to your Chrome!
